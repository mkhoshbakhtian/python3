GasCalculator.py can be used in gas purification calculations. it converts the measured values of a wet pollutant gas with some
level of oxygen and convert it to dry equivalent concentration with referenced oxygen content.

the next one HX_Cost_Estimate.py can estimate the cost of installation of an exchanger and calculate the steam and cooling water
cost to optimise the minimum delta T (temperature difference) required for the exchanger.
